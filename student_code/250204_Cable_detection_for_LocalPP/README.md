# Cable Detection and Pose Estimation
## Overview

This folder contains all code for cable detection and pose estimation using an **Intel RealSense D435** depth camera. The method uses **YOLOv11-Seg** for segmentation to detect cables in the scene and estimate their **2D poses**. The final output is formatted for potential integration into a **costmap for obstacle avoidance** in mobile robots.

The project includes:
- **Capture scripts** to collect real-world RGB and depth images.
- **Segmentation and Pose estimation pipeline** using YOLOv11-Seg to detect cables and transforming the positions of the detected cables into the robotâ€™s base frame.
- **Visualization tools** for evaluating the pose estimation quality.

Due to large file sizes, raw dataset images and pre-trained YOLO models are stored separately.
