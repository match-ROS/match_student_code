## Overview
This folder contains all the codes and function packages used in the student thesis project. This project studies the application of LIO-SAM algorithm on Livox-Mid-360 radar and Mir600 mobile robot platform. The experiment is carried out in the simulation software Gazebo.
Using the evo tool library, the positioning accuracy of LIO-SAM and AMCL algorithms is compared.
